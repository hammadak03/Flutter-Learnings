## Overview
This project demonstrates basic animation concepts in Flutter, including opacity and translation animations. It covers how to use `AnimatedOpacity` and `Transform.translate` to create smooth transitions in your Flutter applications.

## Features
- **Opacity Animation**: Animate the visibility of widgets using `AnimatedOpacity`.
- **Translation Animation**: Move widgets on the screen using `Transform.translate`.
- **AnimationController**: Manage the animation's duration, direction, and repetitions.
- **Tween**: Define the interpolation between start and end values of an animation.
