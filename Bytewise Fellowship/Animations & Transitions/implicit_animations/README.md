# Flutter Implicit Animations

## About Implicit Animations

In Flutter, implicit animations provide a simple and efficient way to add animations to your app's UI. Instead of manually coding animations, you can use built-in widgets that automatically handle animations. When a widget's property changes, it animates smoothly to the new value.

## Animated Widgets in Flutter

Flutter provides several implicit animation widgets, including:

- **`AnimatedContainer`**: Animates changes to its properties like size, color, and shape.
- **`AnimatedOpacity`**: Animates the opacity of a widget.
- **`AnimatedPositioned`**: Animates the position of a widget within a `Stack`.
- **`AnimatedPadding`**: Animates changes to padding values.
- **`AnimatedSwitcher`**: Animates transitions between different widgets.

## Project Description

This Flutter project showcases the `AnimatedContainer` widget to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. The `AnimatedContainer` animates changes in size, color, border radius, and margin over a specified duration, making the UI visually appealing and responsive.

### Code Overview

- **`AnimatedContainerAnimation`**: A stateful widget that manages the state of the `AnimatedContainer` and includes a button to trigger changes.
- **`_AnimatedContainerAnimationState`**: Contains methods to generate random values for the `AnimatedContainer` properties (color, border radius, margin, and size) and update the state.
- **`change()`**: Updates the `AnimatedContainer` properties with random values when called.
- **`initState()`**: Initializes the widget with random values when first created.
- **`build()`**: Constructs the UI, including an `AnimatedContainer` and an `ElevatedButton` to trigger changes.
